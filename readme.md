## Description ##

This is the github version of the official repository for JM Twitter Cards. It's hardly a fork but I'm working on ! I'm trying to improve code structure and I'm adding some cool stuffs.

**THIS IS NOT A FINAL VERSION EVEN IF IT'S ALREADY WORKING ! CONSIDER IT AS AN ALPHA VERSION**


## Changelog ##

# 5.1 #
* 06 Apr 2014
* framework cmB update 
* bugfixes with metaboxes, thumbnails and notices

# 5.0 #
* 30 Mar 2014
* Reformat the entire code. Split the code into several files so it's now better for maintenance. 
* Keep the same keys so you do not have to re-set the plugin options
* Delete fancy design - I kinda loved it but it's too far from native WP UI, some users have difficulties in setting it.
* Use now a framework for metabox and other stuffs so I have not to rewrite all the things to add features
* Add src extra parameter to meta image so that the Twitterbot treats the image as a unique URL and re-fetches the image
